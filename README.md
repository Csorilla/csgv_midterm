# Environmental Conservation Organization

## Project Summary
The Environmental Conservation Organization (ECO) is a web platform dedicated to promoting sustainability, environmental awareness, and conservation efforts. It serves as a hub for individuals and organizations to collaborate on eco-friendly initiatives, access educational resources, and participate in conservation projects.

## Design Choices
### Wireframe
The design follows a clean and modern layout with an emphasis on readability and accessibility. The homepage features a hero section with impactful visuals and a clear call to action. The navigation is intuitive, leading users to key sections such as projects, team members, and impact reports.

### Logo
The logo consists of a minimalist representation of a tree, symbolizing growth and sustainability. It uses a green and teal color palette to evoke a sense of nature and harmony.

### Colors
- **Primary (White - #ffffff):** Used for backgrounds and text contrast.
- **Secondary (Teal - #2a9d8f):** Represents sustainability and is used for buttons and highlights.
- **Tertiary (Black - #000000):** Used for typography and strong contrast elements.

## Bootstrap SCSS Customizations

- The project uses Google Font **Poppins** for a modern and professional look.
- Bootstrap's default font-family has been overridden with `"Poppins", sans-serif`.

### Theme Customization

- The `.btn-pulse` class adds an animated pulse effect to buttons to draw attention.
- Sections such as `.team-section`, `.impact-section`, and `.hero` have been styled for better visual appeal and responsiveness.

### Components & Utilities
